## The assignment
This assignment is based on a real case scenario in Shape Games.
As a result, you should consider that scalability is a big factor to take into account when we develop new features for our Platform.
We hope that you will tackle this assignment thinking about how to keep our platform clean, and support our ever growing list of clients.
We would be glad to hear your honest feedback about the assignment, together with an rougly estimate on how much time you spent on it.

**Here is what we would like you to do:**
- Create a mobile navigation bar and place it in the bottom of the app.
  - The nav-bar should only be visible on smaller screens/devices.
  - The nav-bar should look like the image below (icons can be found in the `public` folder).

- Add functionality to the "My Bets" button in the header AND the mobile nav, so that it can show/hide our sidebar.
  - The button in the header should be hidden on smaller screens/devices.
  - The content of the sidebar is just a image to mock the data, don't change it.
- If you see any issues with the UI you should try to fix it.
- Lastly, if you feel like improving any of our code, feel free to do so.
- We would like you to create a GitHub repo with the code and commit changes along the way. When everything is done, you can share the repo with us.


**NB.** The sidebar looks like this:

**NB.** Initialy the app should look something like this, when you first run `pnpm dev`:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


## Feedback:

I really enjoyed the assignment, especially the focus on scalability rather than just visual output. It felt close to a real production scenario, which I appreciated. The task was clear and well scoped, and It created the perfect opportunity to demonstrate both problem-solving abilities and thoughtful code quality decisions.

Time spent:
Approximately 7-10 hours.
